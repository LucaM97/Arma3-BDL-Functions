# Welcome!
### Here you can find my free Arma 3 functions!


# How to import my functions?

  1. create new folder called BDL (keep your mission folder in order!)
  1. copy and paste one (or more) functions from my repository
  1. open your init.sqf file and add on the top:
  ```
  //i want to import (for example) my earthquake function...

  []execVm "BDL/BDL_earthquake.sqf";

  //thats it!
  ```
# How to use it?
  if you want to try it in console just copy and paste:
  ```
  //this is an example if you need to use BDL_eartquake
  
  [player,10,true]spawn BDL_eartquake;
  
  //easy right?
  ```
